# 2 in 1 Inventory System with Purchase Orders.

### Under construction.

##### Intro:

The objective of this system is a complete management between purchase orders and products in stock. When the order is marked as complete, it will automatically send all its products to the inventory, where it is also possible to make changes.

##### Future Goals:

I'm planning on building a dashboard which will display total orders/products, time in stock and some other relevant information.

##### Progress:

* Back-end 100%
* Front-end 0%

##### Technologies:

* Asp.Net Core
* Angular
