# 2 in 1 Inventory System with Purchase Orders.

### Under construction.

##### Intro:

This is an inventory system with purchase order functionalities, meaning that products are only added to stock after orders are marked as completed. You may start, edit, delete and complete purchase orders, and manage products in the inventory.

##### Future Goals:

I'm planning on building a dashboard which will display total orders/products, time in stock and some other relevant information.

##### Progress:

* Back-end 100%
* Front-end 0%

##### Technologies:

* Asp.Net Core
* Angular
