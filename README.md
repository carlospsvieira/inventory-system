# 2 in 1 Inventory with Purchase Order System

##### Intro:

The purpose of this system is a complete management between purchase orders and products in stock. The order when marked as completed will automatically send all its products to the
inventory, where you can also make changes.

##### Future Goals:

I'm planning on building a dashboard which will display total orders/products, time in stock and some other relevant information.

##### Progress:

* Back-end 100%
* Front-end ~

##### Technologies:

* Asp.Net Core
