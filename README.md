# 2 in 1 Inventory with Purchase Order System

##### Intro:

This system creates purchase orders connected to the inventory, which allows the company to have control over orders, product counts (in and out), suppliers, prices, and more. It is convenient and avoids stock miscounting while keeping track of all transactions.

##### Future Goals:

I'm planning on building a dashboard which will display total orders/products, time in stock and some other relevant information.

##### Progress:

* Back-end 100%
* Front-end ~

##### Technologies:

* Asp.Net Core
* SQL Database
